## New Perspectives and Directions in Philosophy of Communication


### ECREA Philosophy of Communication Section Pre-conference


Philosophy is perhaps the most reflective of all academic disciplines. Philosophers keep asking questions not only about the world, our knowledge of it or the ways we act or should act in it. Rather, the question what philosophy is and what is its place in the world is also a very important philosophical question by itself.
In this one-day event we do not aim at the presentation of mature research, but rather at reflections regarding the state of the philosophy of communications. 
These 3 one hour and a half sessions will all start with brief formal discussion openers by selected members which will form the basis of a conversation on each topic.


1.       **Philosophy in institutions, philosophy of institutions**. This session is devoted to a conversation about the section itself and how it is developing. Why do we need the institutionalization of the philosophy of communication, what forms may it take in the future? Here we will look at what the section can do for early career researchers, how we could enliven exchange within the section and cooperation with other sections.


2.       **In Search for the Fields of Impact**. What impact can philosophy (of communication) have on the world outside of academia? What are the big issues of the day and what is the contribution philosophy of communication can make? What are the topics and questions, or even events philosophy of communication has not considered yet, but definitely should?


3.       **Philosophy of Communication beyond the “parent disciplines”**. How do we see its place in both institutionalized disciplines – philosophy and communication? Should it reach out for dialogue with other disciplines – e.g. linguistics, literary or art studies? What forms do these collaborations take or may take?
